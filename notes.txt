2013 is a controversial year, as many believed Franck Ribery should have won.
argument for that is that while Cristiano Ronaldo had many more goals, his team performed poorly.
Franck Ribery scored way less goals, but his team performed way better and won many more leagues and cups.
Ronaldo had great goal scoring stats, his team performed badly.
Ribery had ok scoring stats, and his team performed great.

One thing a lot of people say about the Balon D'Or is that it is a popularity contest.
The award is given for best individual performance. 
If you look at the award as the best individual player, Franck Ribery arguably should not have won.
